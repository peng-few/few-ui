Skipping build
    → Skipping rebuild of an already fully passed/accepted build
ℹ Skipping rebuild of an already fully passed/accepted build
A build for the same commit as the last build on the branch is considered a rebuild.
If the last build is passed or accepted, the rebuild is skipped because it shouldn't change anything.
You can override this using the --force-rebuild flag.
